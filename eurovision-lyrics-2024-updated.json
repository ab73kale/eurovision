Or destiny?\nDo you take me for a ride?\nPlease, tell me now!\n\nYou're the air, you're the love that I breathe\n(That sounds so good)\nYou're the magic that flows from within\n(I feel that too)\nWe come close then we move far away\nCan't we stay together?\n\nOn again... Off again\nLike the rhythm of rain\nWe need to decide\nFind an end to this game\nSuch wonderful times\nMany natural highs\nLove is a flame, that we can never tame\nOn again... Off again\n\nThere's a river between us\nAnd I need you to come across\nReach out for my heart\nKeep this feeling so alive\nLove grows, We survive\n\nOn again... Off again\nLike the rhythm of rain\nWe need to decide\nFind an end to this game\nSuch wonderful times\nMany natural highs\nLove is a flame, that we can never tame\nOn again... Off again\n\nOff again... On again\nLike a flickering flame\nThat dies in the wind\nAnd lights up again\nSuch wonderful times\nMany natural highs\nLove is a flame, we can never tame\nOn again... Off again\n\nOn again... Off again",

In this world where nothing more is sacred, so far from our values\nBefore the desert wipes out our dreams of colours Take care of our planet, there are so many things to save\nMay the madness of people stop, may our children be able to dream Their eyes turned to the stars, their hands stretched to the sky\nMay the winds carry their sails, may our steps guide their wings We have constructed prisons of glass on forests of ashes\nWe have transformed our universe without trying to understand it On our beaches flows ink, this is the blood of the earth\nMay those who give us orders hear our prayers We dream of a paradise on earth"

Why?\nWill we ever find the answers?\nWhy? Why?\nWhy can't love be all that matters?\nWhy? Why?\nWhile we try to understand\nFaith and hope are slipping through our hands\nCan you tell me why?\nWhat's the secret to make things better?\nWhere's the thread holding us together?\nHow do we find the key that lets us\nOpen up our hearts and minds?\nWinds of faith blow us past our limits\nSpend our lives searching for forgiveness\nCan one voice really make a difference?\nStill I know we've got to try\n(And they say that our trouble's just begun)\nTell me how\n(Tell me how much we'll lose before we've won)\nThese tears won't dry\nSo I\u0092m asking\nWhy?

Can you handle pain?\nCan you handle everything I'm sayin'?\n\nLove can build you up, love can tear you down\nLove can change the world - this is what I've found\nLove can make you happy, love can make you cry\nLove can be the best until it's passed you by\n(Love, love, love)\n\nLove will capture you whole with your body and soul\nLove is taking control of your senses\nLove is guilty as tried, love has no alibi\nLove is breaking down all your defences\nLove...\n\nLove can make you sorry, love can make you weep\nLove can take you over even when you sleep\nLove can give you heaven, love can make you high\nLove can make you cheat and love can make you lie\n\nLove can build you up, love can tear you down\nLove can change the world - this is what I've found\nLove can make you happy, love can make you cry\nLove can be the best until it's passed you by",

Prisoners, hand cuffs\nare not beautiful, dream and glory.\nBut didn't I see those bulletproof vans arrive, flashing lights. I do the rounds and I laugh thinking about that old Ronsard and our teeth are tanned together.\nI hiccup and I laugh for a while and for good we will have escaped,\nand they will never be able to find us again. Our two sparrowhawks, in full flight of summer were plucked, what a nightmare.\nFurther away I used to see, falling tears, on your cheeks enlightened by the headlights.\nTrapped, hang yourself doll, pass me the lighter and never again will they be able to find us. I smoke, I finish by believing that like this black cigarette I harm you my beauty.\nOur grey lungs, our black lungs, what is there to care about when tomorrow is the end of summer. Because nicotine and hearse, little matters tomorrow we will jump, our happiness vanished.\nSo let's do the rounds and the Ronsards, smoke whites and smoke blacks, smile my Bonnie.\nBecause they will never be able to find us again."

Play that romance tonight\nQuietly, softly that it makes me ill\nTha sadness when a nightingale dies\nWhen soul separates from the body Play that romance tonight\nBut slowly, so everyone can hear it\nMay the guitars play again\nI haven't listened to them since long ago They tell me today I'm done, technical waste like a monkey up the tree\nAnd I0m the first internet in the world, on ships with music in a net made of planets And now all the dreams of my songs\nAll fantasies and face that disappeared\nStill are a part of my wakenings\nTrapped, weaved into me a long time ago Play that romance tonight...."

You left me only words,\nA shelter in the shadows\nOrganized books and among the rooms\nYou left me only words\nA bouquet of locks\nMy God, you left me only words Even the ice gets cold when I remember\nHow today you are across from him\nLit by his shadow, fall apart for him\nThe words you left me\nYou are now saying to him"

I thought that angels live in our dreams,\nBut I believed in lies, they live among us\nA desolate heart since you left me\nCome back again, I\u2019m waiting for you, my star and my happiness To the garden of our love, I went to look for you,\nBut you got lost in the crowd, I could not cry\nThe crossroads of soul and our secret supper\nLost in your path, the cycle is now closed. I loved you like an angel, come back into my arms,\nTell me one more time that you love me, redeem my heart\nI loved you like an angel, come into my arms,\nCome again and guide my wilderness to the light. I loved you like an angel"

Ouo uo oo, ouo uo oo\nand now nobody can take this from me anymore. I feel high in every moment I spend with you.\nI don't have to fear what's going to come.\nI won't try to cure myself if I'm healthy, neither will I bear a cross.\nI prefer to enjoy my life looking at what you are. And even though I know very well\nthat there are going to come storms\nand that I will fall down in the future.\nI  know, that at the end of the story\nI will have enjoyed it.\nEspecially what's happening right now.

        "Lyrics translation": "(I'm taking you to the dance, to-to-to-to the dance)\n(Ce-ce-ce-ce, the dance I'm taking you to the dance)\n(I'm taking you to the dance, to-to-to-to the dance)\n(Ce-ce-ce-ce, the dance I'm taking you to the dance) It's a party, it can't end,\nbeat for beat, verse for verse,\nthe whole world's shaking along with her,\nwith one move also and the universe. C'mon take me, free me,\nfrom the nasty stress during the year,\nI can no longer be paranoid,\nit smells like a good party. The dance without stopping on the outside,\non a stage or near a bar itself,\nwhen the day dawns, we're here, it's never a wasteland,\nnothing's a big deal, you just need to get into a stunt. The kick and bass, they infect, they destroy,\nnobody will come with established bazaars,\ntomorrow again along the trodden paths,\nI'm hanging out with my friends, I'm not thinking about the money. Ref.\nLet it last all night and all day,\nit'll get more, it'll get more better trust me,\nbecause we've been born for it,\nI'm taking you I'm taking you, come with me. Come with me now,\nthis is the night,\nthe end can't be seen.\n(I'm taking you to the dance) I need a party that'll never end,\nwhile a woman shakes that piece of meat,\nthe heat is on 200 like in a microwave,\nour brains'll explode, a stroboscope makes flashes. The beat is sick, it's banging on my head,\nmy wallet is empty, give me a drink,\na grill, a clove, a parsley, a fish,\ngive me everything to get fed. And take me somewhere to clear my head,\nsomewhere where the music is playing loud,\nso that it doesn't stop, that it just keeps grooving,\nthat it lasts all night and that everyone are a tuna. The pressure is being suffered, I'm coping with struggle,\ntake me somewhere so that I don't explode,\nI'm opening a can, life is a miracle,\nlet's go to the dance, where should we go else ? Ref.\nLet it last all night and all day,\nit'll get more, it'll get more better trust me,\nbecause we've been born for it,\nI'm taking you I'm taking you, come with me. Come with me now,\nthis is the night,\nthe end can't be seen.\n(I'm taking you to the dance) Just let the beat banging,\nI like everybody here,\nand it doesn't matter that,\nwe all have a thin wallet. Just let the beat banging,\nI like everybody here,\nif the money doesn't help,\nmusic always will. (I'm taking you to the dance, to-to-to-to the dance)\n(Ce-ce-ce-ce, the dance I'm taking you to the dance)\n(I'm taking you to the dance, to-to-to-to the dance)\n(Ce-ce-ce-ce, the dance I'm taking you to the dance)"

        "Lyrics translation": "Again, in the nights, the rain stops its drops.\n[I'm] still trying to capture a smile from between his lips.\nHow much silence speaks; how much it hides,\nHow much truth has remained between the pondering. Only for him will I be able to forget the cold,\nAnd thanks to him will I find, in the darkness, the light;\nOnly for him, will I walk and cross the boundaries,\nOnly with him will I know the answers to the questions. Only for him will I be able to forget the cold,\nAnd thanks to him will I find, in the darkness, the light;\nOnly for him, will I walk and cross the boundaries,\nOnly with him will I know the answers to the questions. Again, in the days, I shall [hold onto] a warm and enveloping gaze; still attempting to caress his face in silence. How many tears have passed, and how many have remained; how many hopes were built, and how many have been broken. Only for him will I be able to forget the cold,\nAnd thanks to him will I find - in the darkness - the light;\nOnly for him, will I walk and cross the boundaries,\nOnly with him will I know the answers to the questions. Only for him will I be able to forget the cold,\nAnd thanks to him will I find, in the darkness, the light;\nOnly for him, will I walk and cross the boundaries,\nOnly with him will I know the answers to the questions. Again, in the days, I shall hold onto a warm and enveloping gaze; still attempting to caress his face in silence. Only for him will I be able to forget the cold,\nAnd thanks to him will I find, in the darkness, the light;\nOnly for him, will I walk and cross the boundaries,\nOnly with him will I know the answers to the questions. Only for him will I be able to forget the cold,\nAnd thanks to him will I find, in the darkness, the light;\nOnly for him, will I walk and cross the boundaries,\nOnly with him will I know the answers to the questions."

But I am there, I don't forget\nIn my village swept away by history\nAnd I live there, don't forget\nErased from the maps and memories I remember the laughter of children\nThe voices of the men leaving for the field\nThe harvest celebrations\nThe smell inside the houses\nThe bursts of love and joy But I am there, don't forget\nErased from the maps and memories When they arrived\nHidden behind their weapons\nThey were thousands\nThey laughed at our tears They wanted to destroy\nOur beliefs and our souls\nWith words of hatred\nThat we didn't know I am here tonight\nIn the middle of these ruins\nTo talk to you about hope\nAnd to sing about life\nAnd I make the promise\nThat when the blood will dry\nI will rebuild my city\nEven more beautiful than before But don't forget"

Undried tear, enlighten this night\nresound today from the silent soul.\nJust a moment the pain stops me\nThis undried tear will drain one day\nfrom the fiery kisses it dreamed\nat that moment the pain will stop. Sweet this life, but it knows no boundaries\nsometimes it caresses us, sometimes it separates us\nI have you far away\nYou make me fight when my powers have given out\nI dream of you even when I am awake As by magic, the moon gazes our stares\nour eyes meet again, even though it is a fantasy\nI will give my life to you."

It is burning\nA fire of love\nIt is burning inside us! It is burning inside us\nLike a dry forest\nLove me! Love me!\nMore and more\nIt will not help! It will not help!\nThe fire brigade Fire! Fire! Fire of love!\nBurns in you, burns in me\nBurns us alive\nLove me now! Love me now!\nHarder and harder\nTake me there, be the air I need to survive"
